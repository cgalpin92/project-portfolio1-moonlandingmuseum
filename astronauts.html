                Neil Alden Armstrong was born on August 5th 1930. Born and raised in Ohio he entered Purdue University
                to study aeronautical engineering, his fees were paid for by the US Navy. Following University,
                Armstrong became a US Navy Midshipman in 1949 and a Naval Aviator the following year. He joined the NASA
                Astronaut Corps in 1962 and made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966,
                becoming NASA’s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. The mission had to be aborted after Armstrong
                was required to use some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused by a stuck
                thruster. In 1969 Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon and his historic words “Its one
                small step for man, one giant leap for man-kind” were broadcast to an estimated 530 million viewers.
                After returning to Earth, Armstrong was hailed a hero and took part in many tours and parades across the
                United States. President Jimmy Carter later presented him with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in
                1978 and he was conducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979. In 2009, along with his
                crewmates, Armstrong received the Congressional Gold Medal.
