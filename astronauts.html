                    <p>Neil Alden Armstrong was born on August 5th 1930. Born and raised in Ohio he entered Purdue
                        University
                        to study aeronautical engineering, his fees were paid for by the US Navy. Following
                        university,
                        Armstrong became a US Navy Midshipman in 1949 and a Naval Aviator the following year. He
                        joined
                        the
                        NASA
                        Astronaut Corps in 1962 and made his first spaceflight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March
                        1966,
                        becoming NASA’s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. The mission had to be aborted
                        after
                        Armstrong
                        was required to use some of his re-entry control fuel to stabilize a dangerous roll caused
                        by a
                        stuck
                        thruster. In 1969 Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon and his historic words
                        “Its
                        one
                        small step for man, one giant leap for man-kind” were broadcast to an estimated 530 million
                        viewers.
                        After returning to Earth, Armstrong was hailed a hero and took part in many tours and
                        parades
                        across
                        the
                        United States. President Jimmy Carter later presented him with the Congressional Space Medal
                        of
                        Honor in
                        1978 and he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1979. In 2009, along
                        with
                        his
                        crewmates, Armstrong received the Congressional Gold Medal.</p>

                    <summary class="p-title" aria-label="click to expand">Buzz Aldrin</summary>
                    <p>Edwin Eugene Aldrin was born on January 20th 1930. He enrolled at West Point Military Academy
                        in
                        1947, graduating in 1951 and joining the United States Air Force where he learnt to fly
                        fighter
                        planes. In 1959, through the Air Force, he enrolled in the Massachusetts School of
                        Technology
                        and
                        earned a doctorate in Astronautics. His thesis was titled “Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques
                        for
                        Manned Orbital Rendezvous”. He was initially declined by NASA but earned a spot in the 3rd
                        round
                        of
                        recruitments after the requirements changed to include 1000 hours flying time in a jet
                        aircraft
                        which Aldrin had. Prior to Apollo 11, Aldrin was part of the Gemini 12 mission, Gemini
                        missions
                        having the primary focus of testing different aspects of the flight that Apollo 11 would
                        eventually
                        take. In 1969 Aldrin became the second man to walk on the moon after having landed the lunar
                        module
                        ‘The Eagle’ alongside Neil Armstrong. Along with Armstrong, Aldrin spent an estimated 2
                        hours on
                        the
                        lunar surface before returning to rendezvous with the Columbia spacecraft and return to
                        Earth.
                        After
                        returning to Earth, Aldrin partook in several tours and appearances around the United States
                        and
                        was
                        also part of the team that designed the Space Shuttle. At the end of the Apollo space
                        program,
                        Aldrin returned to the Air Force where he remained until he retired in 1972.</p>

                    <p>Michael Collins was born on October 31st, 1930, in Rome, Italy. His father was serving in the
                        US
                        Military at the time. He attended West Point Military Academy like his father, brother,
                        uncle
                        and
                        cousins, and graduated in 1952. However, he went on to join the Air Force instead of the
                        Army,
                        motivated by wonder of what the next fifty years might bring in aeronautics. Selected as
                        part of
                        NASA’s third group of 14 astronauts in 1963, Collins flew to space once prior to the Apollo
                        11
                        mission on Gemini 10, in which he performed orbital rendezvous and two spacewalks. In 1969,
                        whilst
                        Armstrong and Aldrin were carrying out their mission on the moon, Collins orbited the moon
                        30
                        times,
                        the second astronaut to have done this alone. Along with Armstrong and Aldrin, Collins was
                        hailed a
                        hero on return to Earth and partook in many parades and tours across the United States.
                        After
                        retiring from NASA in 1970, Collins held several different positions, including Assistant
                        Secretary
                        of State for Public Affairs at the Department of State, director of the National Air and
                        Space
                        Museum, Undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institute and Vice President of LTV Aerospace. He
                        was
                        awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 and later the Congressional Gold Medal in
                        2011.
