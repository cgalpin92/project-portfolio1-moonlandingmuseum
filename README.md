  - The primary font color is white.

  - The fonts Space Grotesk and Rajdhani are used for the Headers and Menus within this project, they stand out so that they catch the user's attention, and also fit with the space and Sci-fi theme.
  - The fonts Raleway and Roboto are used for the main content of the site, they are a softer font and easier to read for the user.

## Features 
### Existing Features

- __Header and Navigation Bar__

  - The Header and Navigation Bar encompases the Logo and Menu. Its featured at the top of the page with the Logo located to the left. The Menu is either located beneath the Header across the whole width of the page when the screen is large enough, or on smaller screens as a burger icon to the top right of the page, which expands vertically when checked.
  - The Header has a light grey background with a black, uppercase font, which is clear and stands out to the user.
  - The Menu consists of 5 pages; Home Page, The Mission, The Astronauts, Visit Us and Volunteer with Us. In contrast to the Header the background is white and the font is smaller with only the first letter of each word capitalized. This is so the Header and the Menu are clearly defined to the user. The current page is highlighted to the user in dark red font.
  - The Header and Menu are identical across all pages to keep consistency and ensure its easy to navigate for the user. Its fully responsive depending on the screen size its viewed on.

### Bugs

- __Fixed Bugs__

 - Hero Element not loading:
    - When first deploying the site through GitHub pages the background image for the Hero Element did not load and the site was broken.
    - I found that this was due to using an absolute file path to the background image in my CSS code.
    - I fixed the issue through changing the file path to a relative file path. The Hero image loaded and the site was fixed.

 - No landing page after submitting volunteer form:
    - After creating the form and testing in both the preview and live environment I was presented with an error landing page when pressing submit. 
    - I found that I had entered the wrong value for method, having originally entered 'post'.
    - After changing this to 'get' the correct confirmation landing page was achieved after the submit button was selected.

 - Header overlapping h2 elements:
   - I found that the header was overlapping part of the h2 elements on each page.
   - I discovered that this was due to some of the additional media queries I had added to my code to enlarge font on larger screens .
   - I fixed this by adding a margin-top property to h2 elements with a value of 8%.

 - Link to Volunteering page not working
   - Link to Volunteering page not working in the third section of Index.html.
   - Found this was due to anchor elements not wrapping the words Volunteering Page.
   - Moved the closing a element so that Volunteering Page wrapped within the two elements and the link as successfully applied.

- __Unfixed Bugs__
  - No unfixed bugs
